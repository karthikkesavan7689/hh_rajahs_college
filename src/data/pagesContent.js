            <h3>Vision of the Institution</h3>
            <p>The vision of the institution is to become a premier institution by providing higher education with excellent quality to the rural youth; to inculcate research spirit and to promote research activity at global standard to inculcate the value of health and hygiene among the youth and to instil entrepreneurship and creativity.</p>
            <p>Quality initiatives such as Special classes for SC/SCA/ST and MBC students are aimed to impart and cement subject knowledge among the students. Collaborations with the small scale or large scale industries are looked upon to promote self-employment among the youngsters.</p>
            <p>Career counselling and competitive examination coaching classes are conducted in order to build students’ confidence and provide them the motivation to face the challenges of their future endeavours. Since majority of the students are first generation - learners, individual counselling for their higher education or job opportunities is the most requisite that is provided to them.</p>
            <p>The college also strives to provide quality education to the rural youth, those who are more or less localized, especially girl students. Besides this, in our endeavour to make the students self-reliant and independent, they are given the freedom and guidance to explore their own opportunities and to tackle the challenges of day to day life; to breed in themselves, the strength and spirit to grow with the world around them. To develop their all-round personality which includes academic, athletic, aesthetic, environmental and ethical values to the fullest extent remains our fundamental objective.</p>
            <p>Despite the economic hurdles, the students are made to acquaint themselves with the immediate needs of the society around them and to develop leadership potential to guide the deprived masses towards a better standard of living, giving due impetus to social justice and democratic citizenship.</p>

            <p>H.H. The Rajah’s College, which was first established in the year 1857, as Maharajah’s Free English Medium School, has now attained the state of an esteemed institution with real potential for excellence. This school, under the first Headmastership of one B.T., Assistant nomination was started by the Thondaiman Kings in the erstwhile Princely State of Pudukkottai in 1879.</p>
            <p>The Free English Medium School started functioning in 1879 in a spare building at Vadakku Raja (North Main) Street in Pudukkottai. The first batch of the final year students of this school were sent for the terminal exam to the Madras University in 1880. Hence, 1880 is considered as the starting year of this College. The College celebrated its centenary year in 1982 and its 125th year in 2006.</p>
            <p>In 1891, the high school classes and the college classes were transferred to the present building. The Head Master of the Maharajah Free English Medium School Mr. S. Narayanaswamy Ayyar B.A., was appointed as the first Principal of this College.</p>
            <p>During the tenure of Mr. S. T. Ramachandra Sastri, as Principal (1912 – 1920), Courses like History, Chemistry, Mathematics, Accountancy, Tamil and Sanskrit were taught to the students. In 1920, after the introduction of the science subjects in the Madras University at PUC Level, the college attained the state of self sufficiency to some extent.</p>
            <p>In 1921, a Boy’s Hostel was built at the southern side of the College playground. In order to provide Vocational Training (Technical Skills) to the students, Motor Rewinding course was offered in 1928. Later, this course was changed into Two Years Technical Course for producing Engineering Graduates.</p>
            <p>In 1946, the Welfare Committee of the Madras University granted permission to this college to start UG Courses. Then, subjects like Economics, History, and Mathematics were taught at UG Level. The College started functioning as the first UG Degree College, affiliated to Madras University from June, 1946.</p>
            <p>Pudukkottai Samasthanam (The Princely State of Pudukkottai) was merged with Trichy District in Madras Presidency in 1948. Since then, the college, now under the control of the Director of People’s Education, Madras Presidency was declared as a Government College.</p>
            <p>Later, quite a few courses were started at regular intervals. B.Com. Degree Course was started in 1949. In 1959, Chemistry was introduced as an elective subject in the UG Science Degree Courses. In addition to it, separate buildings with Rupees One Lakh, were built for Physics and Chemistry Laboratories. B.Sc. Physics and B.Sc. Botany Degree Courses were started in 1961 and 1968 respectively. In 1968, M.Com Degree Course was started in the college. Thus, the college was promoted as the First-Grade PG College of Pudukkottai.</p>
            <p>B.A. English was started in 1980. Subsequently M.A. History and M.Sc. Mathematics were introduced in 1981 and 1982, respectively. The college got affiliated to the Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli in 1982. Then, in 1984, B.Com degree course was offered in the Evening College Stream.</p>
            <p>Now, 5000 plus students (most are with rural background) are studying in our college, compared to the meager strength of 16 students who had enrolled in the Institution for their PUC, way back in 1881.</p>

            <p>Education is the basis of all progress. The entire purpose of education is not to restrict itself to imparting bookish knowledge but to inculcate humanitarian values like wisdom, compassion, courage, humility, integrity and reliability in a student.</p>
            <p>I firmly believe that growth is not an arrow pointing direction, but a hole that expands and lights up. It is a process of transforming all the students to become academically excellent, emotionally stable and socially responsible, and to become GOOD HUMAN BEINGS. Students are the most precious asset and their nurturing is our top priority.</p>

        content: `
            <p>The College has based its motto on the Vedic dictum “Thamasoma Jyotirgmaya” which means “From Darkness to Light” The goal reflects the objectives of higher education with emphasis on the regional demands.</p>
            <p>The institution has the pride of delivering quality higher education for socially and economically weaker students for 142 years. Most of the students getting higher education are first graduates. Several Eminent personalities who have been hailing from Pudukkottai and other adjacent districts have some or more acquaintance with the institution.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, one of the most illustrious alumni Dr. Muthu Lakshmi Reddy had to get special permission from His Highness the King of Pudukkottai Presidency to pursue her higher education in the college as the college was an exclusive Men’s college then. She got admitted as the first female student of the college subject to special provisions and conditions. Later, she became the first woman Doctor of South India. Thus the college had been the source of women empowerment right from the pre-independence period.</p>
            <p>The architecture of the main building makes it a heritage-monument, which imitates a Royal Palace. Well ventilated high roof Lecture Halls, Library and Auditorium halls add distinction to the institution.</p>
